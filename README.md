ebooks
======

A very basic python WSGI web application to browse an ebook collection. 

It allows searching, filtering by letter, getting book's informations (author, description), and downloading.
The application is contained in a single python file. It is not really pythonist as it is made of basic function and no class.
But my objective was to have a dirty basic program quickly working.

I'm serving the application using gunicorn via nginx. You can easily use any other alternative.
